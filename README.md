Global-Terrorism Analysis (Let’s save the world)
 
I have analyzed the data of Global Terrorism . I have the data from the database of the National Sortium of START (Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism). The data contains the events of terrorist activities happened each year from the year 1970-2017.

Data Preprocessing.
Data Analysis and Visualization.
Challenges faced.
Conclusions
Challenges faced:
	Collecting meaningful data: With so much data available, it’s difficult to dig down and access the insights that are needed most.
	Unknown Values: Dealing with the unknown values in the data is a task in itself to analyze in the best way.
	Visual representation of data: To understand data it often needs to be visually presented in graphs or charts. It’s difficult to build them manually. Taking the time to pull information from multiple areas is a time consuming.



Conclusions:
i.	Maximum number of attacks are 16903 across the world in the year 2014.
ii.	Taliban group has executed the maximum number of attacks i.e 7360 in the last two decades.
iii.	Asia is the most affected region by terrorist attacks with Iraq having maximum number of attacks.
iv.	Bombing/ Explosion are the most preferred attack type and the same did the maximum damage too.
